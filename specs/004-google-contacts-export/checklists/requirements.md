# Specification Quality Checklist: Export Triage Results to Google Contacts

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Two scope decisions were resolved up front via clarification (Processing-Queue export = label only;
  one Export screen with separate confirmations), so no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.
- The spec references "Google Contacts", "label/group", and "write permission / incremental consent" at
  a user-facing altitude (consistent with features 001–003); specific API method names are deferred to
  `/speckit-plan`.
